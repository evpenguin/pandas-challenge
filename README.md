# pandas-challenge
Challenge 4

The code & analysis for this challenge is found in the folder PyCitySchools. 
The structure of PyCitySchools.ipnyb follows the structure of the starter code we were given, which can be found in the Starter_Code folder. 
It outputs all the requested DataFrames (named according to the instructions), with formatting where appropriate to make the DataFrames more readable. 

Sources for code I adapted are listed below, and are also explained in comments above the code sections.
